1) Get the code and open it in Jupiter Notebook.
2) We have two datasets: one annotated dataset and one for a collocation algorithm. The annotated dataset is used for classification.
3) Use the collocation algorithm to extract issues with specific patterns.
4) Carry out the procedures for oversampling and undersampling.
