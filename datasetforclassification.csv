I have reached out to the vendor but guess what? It does not exist anymore.To add insult to injury, I have tried to seek a refund from Amazon but its automated system will not allow it.

Before this happened the text I wrote on it kept on freezing I had to wait for the tablet to respond after 40 second or so. The worst part is that if you want to open this document using Adobe reader the only thing that is saved are the high lights and the comments. I cleaned the tablet (galaxy tab 3 8 note) from the junk, the memory and killed background tasks, I uninstalled/installed but that didn't help either Arrrghh to think that I spent 2 hours in this so important document only to re-studying again. i am very sad for it . you shold fix it .",,,

Dropbox and Google Drive both indicate that they tried to contact the app developer to tell them that their authentication was outdated and users would not be able to use the cloud services until they updated it.

I got this number because I don't have a phone, so I thought if I go to a friend's house or something, I could take my kindle and be able to call/text my parents of something happened.  WRONG.  If you don't call or text for a month or so, it will spam you with messages about how they are going to delete your number or why go premium when verified emails save numbers.  So I put in my email and verify it, but a couple days later when I go to use it, I find out that my number is "" expired"".  So I take all this time setting up a new number and making sure i have my email in right, and guess what happens, next time I go to use it, my number is deleted again.  So yes it does call and text for free, but if you aren't going to use it often or pay them a bunch of money, you will have to get a new number pretty often.

About every third message I send, it takes forever and sometimes will never stop saying, ""sending"". I started copying and pasting to try again to send the same message. It usually sends on the third or fourth try. However, as soon as one sends, they all send, even if I deleted the others while they were still sending. So the person I am texting with either gets no text or several of the same text. Absolutely unacceptable for business communication. I would have paid 9 for the app the way it used to be, but I can't see spending one dime if I'm not guaranteed these bugs will go away. Please fix it This was the best app going, before you moneyed with it. I really don't want to have to get a different app and a new phone number.",,,

I was sent to my browser 13 times. Why? What purpose does that serve other than to Piss potential customers off.2. You are TRICKING people into clicking your links. When I press send it takes a few seconds and while my finger is hovering over I press the Ad. I know this because I did it 13 FREAKING Times in one conversation.3. Your App sends messages to the wrong person. You'll be in the middle of typing a message to someone and who you have selected changes before you can press send...because it keeps refreshing BECAUSE OF THE STUPID ADS. There is an Ad per 3 messages in my last conversation.So, you're losing a customer because you're so eager to make a few dimes off of ads I was NEVER GOING TO CLICK. I was going to buy credits but now you guys are so slimy I wouldn't even trust you with my bank info",,,

Having read multiple reviews from other players I know that my experience is not unique but very common. Each state is governed by the players that cheat the most and spend the most money. The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges. However the petty power bullies refuse to allow any smaller players the opportunity to fully engage in the challenges by utterly destroying their base. Wish I never downloaded it. Glad I never spent money on it. Oh, yeah The big power players try to muscle and intimidate other players into spending money to pay them for protection, like the Mafia.

Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying...",,,
fear,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game Money Trap,"Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game.  Epic, has clearly established a platform that has enabled a classic scam to satisfy greed. The game is extreamly frustrating. I played this game when it first started and enjoyed it for a couple of months. When I quit the first time I had just completed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22.  There is a constant push to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective.  Most packs cost 99.  After a year I came back and there now is level 60's. epic offered a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90.  Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astronomical.  Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT).  Epic constantly is modifying the game, ever increasing the need to purchase new packs to achieve the next level. Once a level is extended they are increasing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lower power level does not stand a chance fighting an opponent that is 10 times stronger.  So, the 4.99 catch up offer rapidly turned into 99 packs to keep up.  The current version of the game requires two power steps a week to remain competitive.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this so called game.",,,

The packs they constantly advertise to get you to buy usually cost 99.99 each.  One pack will not do.  There is also a constant bombardment of ads for packs.  The game is pretty glitchy at times too.  Finally, they keep making the number of resources needed to do things and the real time needed to do them that at some point things cost trillions or quadrillions of resources and would take you trillions of days to accomplish is you did not buy speed ups from them.

It doesn't have the advantages of watching ads and earning jewels which the Android had. And I had to start over with level one. I'm now in level 44 and it has taken over a year to get there.

Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And  i dont like BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying...",,,
disgust,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game Money Trap,"Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game.  Epic, has clearly established a platform that has enabled a classic scam to satisfy greed. The game is extreamly frustrating and i dont like this gmae. I played this game when it first started and enjoyed it for a couple of months. When I quit the first time I had just completed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22.  There is a constant push to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective.  Most packs cost 99.  After a year I came back and there now is level 60's. epic offered a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90.  Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astronomical.  Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT).  Epic constantly is modifying the game, ever increasing the need to purchase new packs to achieve the next level. Once a level is extended they are increasing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lower power level does not stand a chance fighting an opponent that is 10 times stronger.  So, the 4.99 catch up offer rapidly turned into 99 packs to keep up.  The current version of the game requires two power steps a week to remain competitive.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this so called game.",,,

There is a lot of busywork necessary to make, upgrade, cobstruct, etc. To be able to fully battle you will need to build a base of min 50 trillion power.This will cost a minimum of 50-100/day. Yes, per day. It will be more in a few weeks. Most people would not spend this much but there are a few can and also MS employees who are playing the game for free.

The other problem is the glitchiness, lag and sever errors due to the massive load on the game. I have had several problems with the game. I've spent close to 700 on I app purchases already, and the programmers say of fixing the issue is by throwing a few perks your way that don't even come close to making up for what their server lag and app crashes cost you. They even had an issue where items in some of their premium packs weren't showing up in your in game inventory when you bought them, and they weren't telling anyone even though they were aware of the issue. They customer support team even admitted this in an email correspondence with me when I confronted them about missing items.fuck fck fuck all",,,

sadness,Game of cash and zero skills,"This game is literally a carbon copy of Game of War, everything about it is the same. They just changed the theme and that's it.  So just like GoW it's simply a TRAP to make money. It has terrible graphics (nothing like the Ads) and needs very little skills and TONS of cash It's also super frustrating when you start as people with thousand times stronger armies simply burn and kill your bases over and over, which is an ingenious way to make you PAY so you could defend yourself and try to grow.Literally everything is about selling you gold EVERYTIME you start the game, or even open a notification they POP-up an Ad to buy gold, over and over and over again. It's ridiculously annoying. Feels like a porn site with pop-up ads. Then, when you decide to buy a pack, it gets interesting. Your first purchase is 5, your second 25, then goes to a 100 and more And they're all the same So the same pack that cost you 5 earlier in the game will cost you 150 later on Exactly the same thing. So basically they're raising the price on the customers who spend money again and again.The strategy part simply doesn't come into play until you are level 21 or above. Until then, it's just a matter of who loses patience and who shells out the cash to get to HQ21. Then you can have battles with your alliance and start strategizing. It takes you easily 45-60 days to get there if you spend less than 100 and even with more spending it takes a month or so.Overall, the game could have been amazing if it wasn't for all the annoying ads and price increasing gold packs, and if it had better structure to help smaller players. Graphics could also be improved, like the fake ads they made.Overall, do NOT let your kids play this game, nor should you. UNLESS you're willing to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEYPS. It's a lot cheaper to buy someone's account online than to start from scratch.",,,

All of this is bad enough but now they've begone literally stealing players money. I bought a 100.00 pack and 5 minutes later got charged a second 100.00 dollars. They refuse to return my money or give the pack I paid for saying they have no record of the purchase. I know 30 people who have had the same thing happen to them. So I decided to play with just gift cards but I ran into the new con where they take the money but don't give you the pack. They swear the items are in my account only they aren't. I've sent 6 Screenshots showing this but they just keep lying and swearing it's there. To make things even worse I began getting attacked last night and the game kicked me out. I tried over and over to get back in only to get a server busy error. I had to uninstall then reinstall to get back in.

I am glad at least that the game itself is free and I understand that the developers have to make some money. But I will not deny my distaste of the game's favoritism to the pay-to-win faction. As for the advertising; once again I understand that in order to get such a game out there, it takes quite a bit. But I think that Arnold Schwarzenegger was a bit overkill. My advice to the developers: try the Linux approach. It's not supposed to be about the money. It's supposed to be about bringing people together to have fun.

fear,Not Ready For Kindle AppStore,"I've played Mobile Strike off both Google and Kindle. It can be a fun time waster provided the application is stable but the Kindle Fire version needs a LOT of work. Obviously, the game designers have put more effort into squeezing your wallet full of your hard earned cash than developing a stable platform. If you're not familiar with MS it's similar in design to Game of War. You construct your base from resources you build but they must be constructed in a proper order. Constructions use resources and cost time. If you plan to spend some time with this game then it's worthwhile to read some of the guides on the net. Those avid, take no prisoners players will quickly decimate your bases, drain your resources and execute your commander. These players, seemingly with unlimited disposable income, dominate most of the areas in the game. A player can literally rack up tens of thousands of dollars with bonus crates with speedup, boosts, extra resources, power options and other powerful items offerred at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT"" . At one point your commander will be stuck at a particular level because you need to acquire 'commendations' which you have no choice but to purchase to get further in the game.

I was sent to my browser 13 times. Why? What purpose does that serve other than to Piss potential customers off.2. You are TRICKING people into clicking your links. When I press send it takes a few seconds and while my finger is hovering over I press the Ad. I know this because I did it 13 FREAKING Times in one conversation.3. Your App sends messages to the wrong person. You'll be in the middle of typing a message to someone and who you have selected changes before you can press send...because it keeps refreshing BECAUSE OF THE STUPID ADS. There is an Ad per 3 messages in my last conversation.So, you're losing a customer because you're so eager to make a few dimes off of ads I was NEVER GOING TO CLICK. I was going to buy credits but now you guys are so slimy I wouldn't even trust you with my bank info",,,

I used to play on an Android product. I was somewhere in the levels between 90 and 100. When my tablet blew up I switched to playing on my Kindle Fire tablet. It doesn't have the advantages of watching ads and earning jewels which the Android had. And I had to start over with level one. I'm now in level 44 and it has taken over a year to get there. Granted, I don't play all day long: I play in the morning before work and at night before bed. But that's always been true. But, as I said, it's getting harder and harder to win just a regular round.",,,

The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges.

Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying...",,,
fear,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game Money Trap,"Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game.  Epic, has clearly established a platform that has enabled a classic scam to satisfy greed. The game is extreamly frustrating. I played this game when it first started and enjoyed it for a couple of months. When I quit the first time I had just completed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22.  There is a constant push to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective.  Most packs cost 99.  After a year I came back and there now is level 60's. epic offered a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90.  Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astronomical.  Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT).  Epic constantly is modifying the game, ever increasing the need to purchase new packs to achieve the next level. Once a level is extended they are increasing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lower power level does not stand a chance fighting an opponent that is 10 times stronger.  So, the 4.99 catch up offer rapidly turned into 99 packs to keep up.  The current version of the game requires two power steps a week to remain competitive.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this so called game.",,,

Unfortunately within about two months it became such a blatant money pit that many stopped playing because we could not keep up with the cost to stay competitive.

Unlikely some games where you can play the game but speed it up with purchases, there are many things you simply cannot do in this game without making purchases.  The purchases are expensive too.  The packs they constantly advertise to get you to buy usually cost 99.99 each.  One pack will not do.  There is also a constant bombardment of ads for packs.  The game is pretty glitchy at times too.  Finally, they keep making the number of resources needed to do things and the real time needed to do them that at some point things cost trillions or quadrillions of resources and would take you trillions of days to accomplish is you did not buy speed ups from them.

fear,So in the long run I wasted my allot of my time and money purchasing the ...,"This is not the coin pack I wanted to purchase. I wanted the 10,000 coin pack, bc you get a bigger discount and more savings. But it would only allow me to purchase 2 of the smallest packs of coins, and I only saved .40. That was not even worth the time I vested in trying to get the savings in the first place. The only reason I tried making the purchase for these smaller packs is because I was told by one of your technical support representative to try that first, and then try the bigger pack. After making the purchases for the smaller packs comma it cut me off. And I was not able to make another purchase at all, let alone the larger pack that I was trying to ultimately get. So in the long run I wasted my allot of my time and money purchasing the smaller packs of coins in the first place. I was finally compensated for it. Thank you for that. But I would have really liked for this issue to have been resolved for any future purchases I would like to make for coin packs.",,,

I fell asleep many times doing this mundane task. So, I don't recommend this game to anyone and if I were Arnold... I would get my face off the game personally.

Overall, he puts this game in the middle ranks of his gaming interest.  It is probably a bit too advanced for him as it is really a strategy game on civilization building and military action.  It is probably more suited to kids in the 8-12 age group.He tells me it is fun, and after watching him play it for a couple of hours, he was well (and quietly) entertained.  Be warned that it is basically a game of nation building, but it has a lot of violence embedded in the results of that nation building.",,,

Whether you receive a support agent with a solid working knowledge of the game seems strictly up to chance.  Overall, for the exhorbitant prices being charged, this game needs to work much, much better. A real pity, because it does have some interesting ideas behind it.

sadness,It is awful,"I downloaded this app on my tablet for my brother I texted my phone and now my phone won't pick up service and is very slow I think it did something to my phone because it was fine before. I am working on trying to get the ""virus/bug"" off my phone .",,,

fear,It is becoming increasingly harder to win,"I have been playing this game for several years and have weathered several iterations of the game. Although recently I have toyed with the idea of not playing any more. It is becoming increasingly difficult to win either the bonus rounds or the regular play. Which makes it not so much fun anymore. I used to play on an Android product. I was somewhere in the levels between 90 and 100. When my tablet blew up I switched to playing on my Kindle Fire tablet. It doesn't have the advantages of watching ads and earning jewels which the Android had. And I had to start over with level one. I'm now in level 44 and it has taken over a year to get there. Granted, I don't play all day long: I play in the morning before work and at night before bed. But that's always been true.

I would love to love this game but all it does is make me bored or frustrated.  I've completed the puzzle at least 200 times now.  Why no quest piece??????2021 update:  After not playing for a while I decided to pick it up again.  There is nothing to do past level 16 besides play the same boring frustrating puzzles over and over.  I need 8000 to get to the next level and each puzzle is 100 exp.  In other words its going to take forever to even progress.  That is the only way to progress by the way because you simply cannot get any of the ""rare"" items that complete a construction.  I have played so many times for just one item and it never shows up.  Not once after years of playing.  The only way to progress is to buy the item with real money and its not like its a dollar.  More like 20.",,,

fear,Nothing is ever free play.,For a while I thought I had found a game where you could actually play for free and get some progression. Silly me.  Had a five day event where you earned crystals and if you reached 160 you'd get to keep however many you earned. Reached 160 two days before end of event and game said I could pay 11.99 to get the bank early. Event ended late last night so logged in today and got a message I could buy the 200+ crystals I had earned for 11.99. Slick. Obviously this is only going to get worse.,,,

sadness,this has to not  work,I have one brother and one sister and when I tested it it showed where they both were on the radar? Both of them were staying still inside there room.

There were a lot more but I cant think of them right now. all in all its a fun app. but beware..it may creep you out.",,,

Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And  i dont like BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying...",,,
disgust,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game Money Trap,"Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game.  Epic, has clearly established a platform that has enabled a classic scam to satisfy greed. The game is extreamly frustrating and i dont like this gmae. I played this game when it first started and enjoyed it for a couple of months. When I quit the first time I had just completed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22.  There is a constant push to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective.  Most packs cost 99.  After a year I came back and there now is level 60's. epic offered a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90.  Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astronomical.  Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT).  Epic constantly is modifying the game, ever increasing the need to purchase new packs to achieve the next level. Once a level is extended they are increasing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lower power level does not stand a chance fighting an opponent that is 10 times stronger.  So, the 4.99 catch up offer rapidly turned into 99 packs to keep up.  The current version of the game requires two power steps a week to remain competitive.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this so called game.",,,

They release some new pack every few days to few weeks, and the 99.99 packs are the only ones even worth buying because the others won't even keep you competitive with anyone else in the game. The other problem is the glitchiness, lag and sever errors due to the massive load on the game. I have had several problems with the game. I've spent close to 700 on I app purchases already, and the programmers say of fixing the issue is by throwing a few perks your way that don't even come close to making up for what their server lag and app crashes cost you. They even had an issue where items in some of their premium packs weren't showing up in your in game inventory when you bought them, and they weren't telling anyone even though they were aware of the issue. They customer support team even admitted this in an email correspondence with me when I confronted them about missing items.fuck fck fuck all",,,

sadness,Game of cash and zero skills,"This game is literally a carbon copy of Game of War, everything about it is the same. They just changed the theme and that's it.  So just like GoW it's simply a TRAP to make money. It has terrible graphics (nothing like the Ads) and needs very little skills and TONS of cash It's also super frustrating when you start as people with thousand times stronger armies simply burn and kill your bases over and over, which is an ingenious way to make you PAY so you could defend yourself and try to grow.Literally everything is about selling you gold EVERYTIME you start the game, or even open a notification they POP-up an Ad to buy gold, over and over and over again. It's ridiculously annoying. Feels like a porn site with pop-up ads. Then, when you decide to buy a pack, it gets interesting. Your first purchase is 5, your second 25, then goes to a 100 and more And they're all the same So the same pack that cost you 5 earlier in the game will cost you 150 later on Exactly the same thing. So basically they're raising the price on the customers who spend money again and again.The strategy part simply doesn't come into play until you are level 21 or above. Until then, it's just a matter of who loses patience and who shells out the cash to get to HQ21. Then you can have battles with your alliance and start strategizing. It takes you easily 45-60 days to get there if you spend less than 100 and even with more spending it takes a month or so.Overall, the game could have been amazing if it wasn't for all the annoying ads and price increasing gold packs, and if it had better structure to help smaller players. Graphics could also be improved, like the fake ads they made.Overall, do NOT let your kids play this game, nor should you. UNLESS you're willing to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEYPS. It's a lot cheaper to buy someone's account online than to start from scratch.",,,

In total I have spent 13,450.00 and I'm now way behind everyone else. They add new things every 3/4 days now and if you don't have it you're too weak to compete. All of this is bad enough but now they've begone literally stealing players money. I bought a 100.00 pack and 5 minutes later got charged a second 100.00 dollars. They refuse to return my money or give the pack I paid for saying they have no record of the purchase. I know 30 people who have had the same thing happen to them. So I decided to play with just gift cards but I ran into the new con where they take the money but don't give you the pack. They swear the items are in my account only they aren't. I've sent 6 Screenshots showing this but they just keep lying and swearing it's there. To make things even worse I began getting attacked last night and the game kicked me out. I tried over and over to get back in only to get a server busy error. I had to uninstall then reinstall to get back in. When I did I found out the game switched my gear so I was weaker and that I had lost over half of my billions of troops. Do not be fooled this game is now crap and not worth playing.",,,

I am glad at least that the game itself is free and I understand that the developers have to make some money. But I will not deny my distaste of the game's favoritism to the pay-to-win faction. As for the advertising; once again I understand that in order to get such a game out there, it takes quite a bit. But I think that Arnold Schwarzenegger was a bit overkill. My advice to the developers: try the Linux approach. It's not supposed to be about the money. It's supposed to be about bringing people together to have fun.

You can get by with the 19.99 and 49.99 packs they offer from time to time, but your progression will be painfully slow.The came can become quite time consuming. You'll want to plan at least one hour a day, with a shorter session at a different time.There is a sense of a virtual community as you work within whatever Alliance you join (definite advantages to joining), so its not just one-on-one competition.

I have played for a few weeks and every time I get to a certain power, the reigning alliance destroys my base and takes all of my resources.

It can be a fun time waster provided the application is stable but the Kindle Fire version needs a LOT of work. Obviously, the game designers have put more effort into squeezing your wallet full of your hard earned cash than developing a stable platform. If you're not familiar with MS it's similar in design to Game of War. You construct your base from resources you build but they must be constructed in a proper order. Constructions use resources and cost time. If you plan to spend some time with this game then it's worthwhile to read some of the guides on the net. Those avid, take no prisoners players will quickly decimate your bases, drain your resources and execute your commander. These players, seemingly with unlimited disposable income, dominate most of the areas in the game. A player can literally rack up tens of thousands of dollars with bonus crates with speedup, boosts, extra resources, power options and other powerful items offerred at a ""HUGE DISCOUNT"" . At one point your commander will be stuck at a particular level because you need to acquire 'commendations' which you have no choice but to purchase to get further in the game.

How is this free texting to really phone numbers?  If you have to buy credits then it is not free if you HAVE TO use credits.

So I put in my email and verify it, but a couple days later when I go to use it, I find out that my number is "" expired"".  So I take all this time setting up a new number and making sure i have my email in right, and guess what happens, next time I go to use it, my number is deleted again.  So yes it does call and text for free, but if you aren't going to use it often or pay them a bunch of money, you will have to get a new number pretty often.

If they want people to use it with the phone part, you must give a local number or at least the same area code.Update, bumped down to 1 star because it wants to charge 5 credit per text to a USA number from a USA number.  How is this free texting to really phone numbers?  If you have to buy credits then it is not free if you HAVE TO use credits.

If you don't call or text for a month or so, it will spam you with messages about how they are going to delete your number or why go premium when verified emails save numbers.  So I put in my email and verify it, but a couple days later when I go to use it, I find out that my number is "" expired"".  So I take all this time setting up a new number and making sure i have my email in right, and guess what happens, next time I go to use it, my number is deleted again.  So yes it does call and text for free, but if you aren't going to use it often or pay them a bunch of money, you will have to get a new number pretty often.

I was sent to my browser 13 times. Why? What purpose does that serve other than to Piss potential customers off.2. You are TRICKING people into clicking your links. When I press send it takes a few seconds and while my finger is hovering over I press the Ad. I know this because I did it 13 FREAKING Times in one conversation.3. Your App sends messages to the wrong person. You'll be in the middle of typing a message to someone and who you have selected changes before you can press send...because it keeps refreshing BECAUSE OF THE STUPID ADS. There is an Ad per 3 messages in my last conversation.So, you're losing a customer because you're so eager to make a few dimes off of ads I was NEVER GOING TO CLICK. I was going to buy credits but now you guys are so slimy I wouldn't even trust you with my bank info",,,

The only way to succeed is to spend more money than the other players, or hack the game for items that would cost money. The culminating purpose of the game is to have each state work together to beat out other states in point challenges. However the petty power bullies refuse to allow any smaller players the opportunity to fully engage in the challenges by utterly destroying their base. Wish I never downloaded it.

Literally, I've found out that you kind of need to get past level 21 to get any cool units like DELTA FORCE or Mercenaries, or anything that can defend your base or attack other bases successfully.  Well, guess what, even with that lofty starters package I purchased for 4.99 and then 19.99, to get to level 21, you need special things like Magic Hammers, and what not, to upgrade the buildings in the base.  And BRILLIANTLY, that cutoff at level 20 is where boys become men, and all for the low price of 99.99.I really do miss the old days of PC games where you literally might pay 99.99 but you own it, you play it for months and years, and you don't have to input a single extra red cent.  MOBILE STRIKE IS A MONEY PIT, a black hole for your hard earned money (real money), and they got my last nickel for sure.  I just hope other people don't waste their time in building up a base only to find out they WILL get overrun, destroyed, your commander killed by someone who was willing to stupidly fork over 99.99 or more to steamroll over those of us who refused to do so.Just saying...",,,
fear,Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game Money Trap,"Mobile Strike is a poor excuse for a game.  Epic, has clearly established a platform that has enabled a classic scam to satisfy greed. The game is extreamly frustrating. I played this game when it first started and enjoyed it for a couple of months. When I quit the first time I had just completed level 21 and within a few days they came out with level 22.  There is a constant push to spend money to keep your forces at a level to be effective.  Most packs cost 99.  After a year I came back and there now is level 60's. epic offered a catch up pack for 4.99. Not bad I thought. The next pack was 19.00 to bring me to a level 90.  Within 3 weeks they are offering level 125's. the numbers used to track resources are astronomical.  Numbers like Million - Trillion- Trillion- Trillion (MTTT).  Epic constantly is modifying the game, ever increasing the need to purchase new packs to achieve the next level. Once a level is extended they are increasing the newest power levels by factors of 10. By doing that a person with a lower power level does not stand a chance fighting an opponent that is 10 times stronger.  So, the 4.99 catch up offer rapidly turned into 99 packs to keep up.  The current version of the game requires two power steps a week to remain competitive.  I would highly recommend to stay away from this so called game.",,,

Unfortunately within about two months it became such a blatant money pit that many stopped playing because we could not keep up with the cost to stay competitive.

The packs they constantly advertise to get you to buy usually cost 99.99 each.  One pack will not do.  There is also a constant bombardment of ads for packs.  The game is pretty glitchy at times too.  Finally, they keep making the number of resources needed to do things and the real time needed to do them that at some point things cost trillions or quadrillions of resources and would take you trillions of days to accomplish is you did not buy speed ups from them.

Considering how glitchy the software is, and always at the worst possible time, it's definitely not worth it unless you're independently wealthy. There is simply no way to effectively compete unless you're shelling out lots of money.  Game rules and explanations are rudimentary at best, and while there have been obvious attempts to make the game interface as intuitive as possible, it still has a very long way to go. All of this makes for a considerable amount of confusion for new players.  Customer support has generally been timely, but helpful or useful only about half the time. Whether you receive a support agent with a solid working knowledge of the game seems strictly up to chance.  Overall, for the exhorbitant prices being charged, this game needs to work much, much better. A real pity, because it does have some interesting ideas behind it.

So after having to spend 100s or 1000s to build up your base the user is left with nothing to do.

It doesn't have the advantages of watching ads and earning jewels which the Android had. And I had to start over with level one. I'm now in level 44 and it has taken over a year to get there. Granted, I don't play all day long: I play in the morning before work and at night before bed. But that's always been true. But, as I said, it's getting harder and harder to win just a regular round.",,,

fear,Very stressful game unless you are able or willing to ...,Very stressful game unless you are able or willing to spend real money you advance very slowly  If you are after something in particular you have to beat quest after quest and still don't get it all you get is energy or something you already have tons of seriously thinking of uninstalling the game.  Support is of no help they just keep sending you nonsense emails,,,

disgust,Have potential,"But it takes too long to ""find"" items. You have to play the same levels over and over and over again, using up all your energy and sometimes never making any progress towards collections. I really  dont like the game but having played for (far too many) days it's disappointing to make such small steps towards items. A collection can have a requirement of 30 things, some of which it seems you can never ""find"" but rather have to ""buy"".",,,

fear,Decent entertainment,Quests are impossible to complete as you cannot find all required items without in game purchase. For a match game it is not bad but if you want to actually  complete collections expect to pay.,,,
fear,It's annoying with it's tutorials throughout,"You can only play for 5 minutes before it asks you to pay if you want to play more... not worth the free version. Buy it? No, not worth that either. It's annoying with it's tutorials throughout. And you can't turn off the noise either.",,,

fear,Fun but can be frustrating,"My sister-in-law has this for her IPad, so I was delighted to find the Kindle version. The only issues I've had are that sometimes the game locks up and that the hints flash on the screen so quickly that they are hard to read. Probably  a problem for more experienced gamers",,,

fear,Frustrating,1. The game has frozen and made itself impossible to keep all the progress.2.  Wish that there many more ways to use or gain gems to play3. Wish that there were more assistance for finishing levels.4.  Customer service is efficient however there should be a way to get personal help after more than three or four email exchanges still does not solve the issue.,,,

disgust,Cradle of Empires,I don’t Love the game  I have been playing it for a while and an never board.  The only thing is you never know when you are going to win the object you are trying for.  It would be nice if there was a way to know when you are going to earn goal objects.,,,

fear,Annoyed with this game,"I would love this game if it didn't take months of playing the same puzzle multiple times a day until out of energy each time and still never getting that quest piece let alone any of those other little things needed to complete a collection to progress the game.  I would love to love this game but all it does is make me bored or frustrated.  I've completed the puzzle at least 200 times now.  Why no quest piece??????2021 update:  After not playing for a while I decided to pick it up again.  There is nothing to do past level 16 besides play the same boring frustrating puzzles over and over.  I need 8000 to get to the next level and each puzzle is 100 exp.  In other words its going to take forever to even progress.  That is the only way to progress by the way because you simply cannot get any of the ""rare"" items that complete a construction.  I have played so many times for just one item and it never shows up.  Not once after years of playing.  The only way to progress is to buy the item with real money and its not like its a dollar.  More like 20.",,,
fear,A lot of fun but...,I'm having problems when I try to click on buttons to play the game. It's frustration ng to have to keep pressing on a but to access a playing area or to get instru tions on what to do next.,,,
fear,"otherwise fun, but annoying because of the 'buy energy, crystals, items etc...' nature of the game","I'd rather buy a full game for 10 (or something) than use a single cent to any freemium pay for every item moneytrap. Now the makers won't get a dime from me, but unfortunately there'll Always Be people fool enough to waste their money :-(",,,

disgust,Disappointed,Didnt like at all because its Confusing and disappointing,,,
fear,Nothing is ever free play.,For a while I thought I had found a game where you could actually play for free and get some progression. Silly me.  Had a five day event where you earned crystals and if you reached 160 you'd get to keep however many you earned. Reached 160 two days before end of event and game said I could pay 11.99 to get the bank early. Event ended late last night so logged in today and got a message I could buy the 200+ crystals I had earned for 11.99. Slick. Obviously this is only going to get worse.,,,
